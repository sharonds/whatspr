# WhatsApp PR Agent - Claude Code MVP Workflow Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ What You've Just Implemented

You now have a streamlined 5-step MVP development workflow with specialized sub-agents that will:

- **Prevent Claude from bypassing quality gates**
- **Enforce MVP TDD planning before implementation**
- **Provide essential security and QA review**
- **Ship core functionality directly to production**
- **Maintain essential documentation**
- **Organize clean, deployable git commits**
- **Generate production-focused PR descriptions**

## ðŸš€ Prerequisites

Before using this workflow, ensure you have:

```bash
# Install Claude Code CLI
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify installation
claude --version

# Verify you have Node.js 18+
node --version
```

## âœ… Setup Verification

Run these commands to verify everything is configured correctly:

```bash
# 1. Verify directory structure
ls -la .claude/
ls -la .claude/commands/
ls -la .claude/agents/

# 2. Count files (should be 17 total: 6 agents + 8 commands + 3 docs)
find .claude -name "*.md" | wc -l

# 3. Check workflow documentation
cat .claude/WORKFLOW.md | head -20
```

## ðŸŽ¯ First Usage - MVP Feature Development Example

Here's how to use the MVP workflow for rapid feature development:

### Step 1: Start Claude Code Session
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/sharonsciammas/whatspr-staging

# Start Claude Code
claude
```

### Step 2: MVP Feature Planning
```
/blueprint

Feature request: "Add user authentication with email/password for WhatsApp bot admin panel"
```

The blueprint specialist will:
- âœ… Create essential failing tests for core functionality
- âœ… Focus on MVP features (login, logout, basic security)
- âœ… Recommend minimal file structure
- âœ… Plan direct production deployment
- âœ… Defer advanced features for later iterations

### Step 3: Follow MVP TDD Implementation
Implement core functionality only, following the test-driven approach from the blueprint.

### Step 4: Essential Quality Review
```
/qa-review

Feature Name: User Authentication
Key Implementation: Basic email/password login with essential security validation
```

### Step 5: Essential Documentation
```
/update-docs

Feature Name: User Authentication
Key Changes: Login endpoints, environment variables, production deployment notes
```

### Step 6: Clean Git Commits
```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Get expert commit organization
/review-commits

Feature Name: User Authentication
Scope: Auth components, API endpoints, essential documentation
```

### Step 7: Production-Ready PR
```
/create-pr

Feature Name: User Authentication
Implementation: MVP user authentication system ready for production deployment
```

## ðŸ”§ Integration with Your Current Workflow

### Your Existing Test Structure
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ e2e/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_conversation_flow.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ test_tools_atomic.py
â”œâ”€â”€ test_prompt_exists.py
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### How MVP Workflow Enhances Your Process
- **MVP Planning**: Blueprint specialist focuses on essential functionality first
- **Essential QA**: Security expert validates critical issues only
- **Direct Deployment**: Skip staging, ship core features to production quickly
- **Essential Docs**: Technical writer updates only production-critical information

## ðŸŽ¯ MVP Workflow Benefits for Your Project

### Speed & Focus
- **Ship core features fast** - Essential functionality over perfect infrastructure
- **Direct production deployment** - Faster user feedback and iteration
- **Essential quality gates only** - Skip over-engineering

### Professional Standards
- **Clean git history** - Deployable commits with conventional format
- **Essential documentation** - Production-critical information only
- **Production-ready PRs** - Focused descriptions for immediate deployment

### Time Efficiency
- **3-4 minutes overhead** for complete MVP development cycle
- **Expert knowledge** focused on shipping quickly
- **Context preservation** throughout rapid development workflow

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

### Context Management
- Always specify feature name when using commands
- Use `/context-sync` if switching between features
- Use `/workflow-status` to check current progress

### Fallback Behavior
- Each command includes fallback instructions
- If sub-agents don't respond, main Claude continues with expert criteria
- Restart Claude Code session if sub-agents become unresponsive

### Git Integration
- Workflow works with feature branches for rapid development
- Direct production deployment after PR approval
- Preserves your existing test structure with MVP focus

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Try the MVP workflow** with a small feature to test the process
2. **Use strategic planning** periodically: `/strategic-planning`
3. **Train your team** on the 5-step MVP process
4. **Monitor shipping velocity** and user feedback from rapid deployments
