# WhatsApp PR Agent - Claude Code Workflow Setup Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ What You've Just Implemented

You now have a professional 6-step development workflow with specialized sub-agents that will:

- **Prevent Claude from bypassing quality gates**
- **Enforce TDD planning before implementation**
- **Provide expert security and QA review**
- **Automate staging deployment preparation**
- **Maintain professional documentation**
- **Organize clean, atomic git commits**
- **Generate reviewer-focused PR descriptions**

## ðŸš€ Prerequisites

Before using this workflow, ensure you have:

```bash
# Install Claude Code CLI
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code

# Verify installation
claude --version

# Verify you have Node.js 18+
node --version
```

## âœ… Setup Verification

Run these commands to verify everything is configured correctly:

```bash
# 1. Verify directory structure
ls -la .claude/
ls -la .claude/commands/
ls -la .claude/agents/

# 2. Count files (should be 15 total)
find .claude -name "*.md" | wc -l

# 3. Check workflow documentation
cat .claude/WORKFLOW.md | head -20
```

## ðŸŽ¯ First Usage - E2E Testing Enhancement Example

Here's how to use the workflow for your current E2E testing work:

### Step 1: Start Claude Code Session
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/sharonsciammas/whatspr-staging

# Start Claude Code
claude
```

### Step 2: Initialize Feature Planning
```
/blueprint

Feature request: "Add comprehensive E2E testing for difficult conversation inputs and edge cases in the WhatsApp PR agent, including validation of atomic tool calls and goal-oriented prompt behavior"
```

The blueprint specialist will:
- âœ… Create comprehensive failing test suite
- âœ… Suggest git branch (feat/e2e-difficult-inputs)
- âœ… Recommend file structure based on your existing tests/
- âœ… Assess deployment complexity
- âœ… Plan implementation strategy

### Step 3: Follow TDD Implementation
Implement the features following the test-driven approach from the blueprint.

### Step 4: Expert Quality Review
```
/qa-review

Feature Name: E2E Testing Enhancement
Key Implementation: Added comprehensive conversation flow tests with difficult inputs, atomic tool validation, and staging verification
```

### Step 5: Staging Deployment Preparation
```
/staging-deploy

Feature Name: E2E Testing Enhancement
Implementation Summary: New E2E test suite with edge case validation and tool call verification
```

### Step 6: Documentation Updates
```
/update-docs

Feature Name: E2E Testing Enhancement
Key Changes: New testing procedures, E2E validation steps, staging test protocols
```

### Step 7: Organize Git Commits
```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Get expert commit organization
/review-commits

Feature Name: E2E Testing Enhancement
Scope: Test files, documentation, staging scripts, validation procedures
```

### Step 8: Create Professional PR
```
/create-pr

Feature Name: E2E Testing Enhancement
Implementation: Comprehensive E2E testing framework for WhatsApp conversation flows with difficult input validation
```

## ðŸ”§ Integration with Your Current Workflow

### Your Existing Test Structure
```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ e2e/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ test_conversation_flow.py
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ test_tools_atomic.py
â”œâ”€â”€ test_prompt_exists.py
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

### How Workflow Enhances Your Process
- **TDD Planning**: Blueprint specialist will suggest additional E2E test scenarios
- **QA Review**: Security expert will validate input sanitization and tool dispatch safety
- **Staging**: DevOps specialist will ensure isolated staging environment setup
- **Documentation**: Technical writer will update testing procedures and troubleshooting guides

## ðŸŽ¯ Workflow Benefits for Your Project

### Quality Control
- **Prevents rushed implementations** - Forces planning phase first
- **Security validation** - Expert review of WhatsApp input handling
- **Staging safety** - Deployment verification before production

### Professional Standards
- **Clean git history** - Atomic commits with conventional format
- **Complete documentation** - Always updated with new features
- **Reviewer-ready PRs** - Professional descriptions with testing guidance

### Time Efficiency
- **4-5 minutes overhead** for complete professional development cycle
- **Expert knowledge** at each phase without manual research
- **Context preservation** throughout entire workflow

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

### Context Management
- Always specify feature name when using commands
- Use `/context-sync` if switching between features
- Use `/workflow-status` to check current progress

### Fallback Behavior
- Each command includes fallback instructions
- If sub-agents don't respond, main Claude continues with expert criteria
- Restart Claude Code session if sub-agents become unresponsive

### Git Integration
- Workflow works with your existing branch: `feat/e2e-difficult-inputs`
- Maintains your staging environment setup
- Preserves your existing test structure

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Try the workflow** with your current E2E testing enhancement
2. **Customize sub-agents** if needed for your specific domain knowledge
