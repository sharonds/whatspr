### ✅ **MVP-Optimized Sub-Agents**
- **blueprint-specialist**: Focus on essential tests, MVP planning
- **qa-specialist**: Critical issues only, production safety
- **documentation-specialist**: Essential docs, defer comprehensive
- **git-specialist**: Fewer, logical commits vs atomic perfection
- **pr-specialist**: 150-word limit, production-focused
- **strategic-planner**: NEW - MVP prioritization and user value

### ✅ **Streamlined Commands**
