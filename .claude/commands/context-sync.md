**Context Synchronization Check**

Please review the current workflow state:

1. **Current Feature:** [Detect from git branch or ask user to specify]
2. **Files Changed:** [Check git status and staged changes]
3. **Workflow Progress:** [Determine which steps completed based on file changes/commits]
4. **Next Recommended Step:** [Based on current state]

**Context Summary for Sub-Agents:**
Provide a brief context summary that can be used in subsequent commands:
- Feature name and purpose
- Key files involved
- Current implementation status
- Any critical considerations

**Use this command:** When switching between workflow steps or if context seems unclear.
