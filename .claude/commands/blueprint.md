What feature do you want to build?

Please:
1. Suggest a git branch name (feat/xxx format)
2. Create a failing test that defines success criteria
3. List 3-4 files I'll likely need to create

Don't write any implementation code yet - just the failing test and plan.

Remember this feature for the rest of our workflow session.
