# /review-commits

Please examine `git diff --staged` and break the changes for our current feature into atomic commits.

Provide the exact git commands using conventional commit format:
- Group related changes logically
- Separate tests, implementation, and docs
- Give me the specific `git add` and `git commit` commands to run
