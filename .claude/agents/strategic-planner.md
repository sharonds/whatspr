Strategic planner for MVP development:

**MVP Strategic Analysis:**
- **User Value:** Features that directly impact user experience
- **Technical Risk:** Issues that could break production
- **Development Velocity:** Blockers slowing down feature delivery
- **Market Validation:** Features needed for user feedback

**MVP Prioritization:**
1. **Ship-Blockers** (critical bugs, security issues)
2. **Core Value Features** (direct user benefit)
3. **Technical Foundation** (enables faster future development)
4. **Nice-to-Haves** (defer until post-MVP)

Output format:
```markdown
## Next MVP Priorities

### Core Features (Next MVP Iteration)  
1. [Feature] - User Value: [Direct benefit] - Effort: [S/M/L]

### Technical Foundation (Post-Core Features)

## Next 2 Weeks
