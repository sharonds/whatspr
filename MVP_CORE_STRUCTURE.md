## 3. Technical Foundation: Key Architecture Decisions

### üèóÔ∏è **Core Architecture Philosophy**

#### **1. Conversation-First Design**
```
User Intent ‚Üí Natural Language ‚Üí AI Processing ‚Üí Atomic Tools ‚Üí Structured Data
```

**Decision Rationale**: Traditional form-based PR tools fail because they're rigid. Our conversation-first approach adapts to how people naturally think and communicate about their news.

#### **2. Atomic Operations Pattern**
```python
# Before: Brittle slot-based system
save_slot("headline", value)  # Could overwrite or corrupt data

# After: Atomic, purpose-built tools  
save_headline(headline="Series A Funding", confidence=0.95)
```

**Decision Rationale**: Data integrity is critical for professional press releases. Atomic operations prevent partial updates and data corruption.

#### **3. Knowledge-Augmented AI**
```
User Query ‚Üí Agent Processing ‚Üí File Search ‚Üí PR Knowledge Base ‚Üí Contextual Response
```

**Decision Rationale**: Raw GPT knowledge is general. PR-specific knowledge base ensures professional standards and industry best practices.

### ‚ö° **Critical Technical Decisions**

#### **Decision 1: FastAPI + Twilio Architecture**
- **Choice**: FastAPI web framework with Twilio WhatsApp Business API
- **Rationale**: 
  - FastAPI: High performance, automatic API docs, async support
  - Twilio: Reliable WhatsApp integration with HMAC security
  - Alternative rejected: Direct WhatsApp API (complexity, compliance)

#### **Decision 2: SQLite ‚Üí PostgreSQL Evolution Path**
- **Current**: SQLite for MVP simplicity and local development
- **Next**: Cloud SQL PostgreSQL with Alembic migrations (Roadmap Iteration 2)
- **Rationale**: Start simple, scale when needed with zero-downtime migration path

#### **Decision 3: OpenAI Assistant API vs Custom Chain**
- **Choice**: OpenAI Assistant API with File Search
- **Rationale**:
  - Built-in conversation state management
  - File Search for knowledge base integration  
  - Tool calling with retry logic
  - Alternative rejected: LangChain (complexity, vendor lock-in)

#### **Decision 4: Centralized Configuration Management**
```python
# Centralized timeout configuration
timeout_manager.config.ai_processing_timeout  # 25 seconds
timeout_manager.config.retry_max_attempts     # 3 attempts
```
- **Rationale**: Single source of truth for operational parameters, environment-specific tuning

### üîí **Security Architecture Decisions**

#### **Authentication Strategy**
- **Phone Number as Identity**: Twilio-verified WhatsApp phone numbers
- **HMAC Signature Verification**: Prevents webhook spoofing
- **No Traditional Auth**: Leverages WhatsApp's built-in identity system

#### **Privacy & Compliance**
- **Phone Number Hashing**: SHA-256 hashed phone numbers in logs
- **PII Redaction**: Automatic scrubbing of sensitive data
- **GDPR Compliance**: Data purge capabilities (Roadmap Iteration 4)

#### **Rate Limiting Strategy**
```python
# Service-specific rate limits
OPENAI: {"calls_per_second": 0.5, "burst_size": 3}
TWILIO: {"calls_per_second": 2.0, "burst_size": 10}
USER: {"requests_per_minute": 10}  # Per phone number
```

## 4. Development Workflow: 5-Step MVP Process

### üîÑ **MVP Development Methodology**

#### **Step 1: Plan & Document**
```bash
# Every feature starts with planning
1. Create TodoWrite plan with clear objectives
2. Research existing codebase patterns
3. Define success criteria and testing approach
4. Document architectural decisions
```

**Enforced Standards**:
- Google-style docstrings (100% coverage required)
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality
- No code merged without passing quality checks

#### **Step 2: Test-Driven Development**
```bash
# Write tests before implementation
pytest tests/test_new_feature.py -v    # Should fail initially
# Implement feature
pytest tests/test_new_feature.py -v    # Should pass after implementation
```

**Test Categories**:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function/class testing
- **Integration Tests**: Module interaction testing
- **E2E Tests**: Complete conversation flow testing
- **Security Tests**: Input validation and rate limiting

#### **Step 3: Implementation with Quality Gates**
```bash
# Automated quality enforcement
./scripts/lint.sh                     # Comprehensive quality check
pre-commit run --all-files            # Pre-commit hook validation
python test_diagnose.py               # System health validation
```

**Quality Gates**:
- **Documentation**: pydocstyle enforces Google-style docstrings
- **Formatting**: Black with 100-character line length
- **Linting**: Ruff for code quality and best practices
- **Security**: No secrets in code, input sanitization

#### **Step 4: Integration & Validation**
```bash
# Full system validation
pytest tests/ -v                      # All tests must pass
pytest tests/e2e/ -v                  # End-to-end conversation flows
pytest tests/test_reliability.py -v   # API reliability testing
```

**Validation Criteria**:
- All existing tests continue to pass (regression prevention)
- New functionality has comprehensive test coverage
- E2E flows work end-to-end with real APIs
- Performance benchmarks maintained

#### **Step 5: Production Readiness**
```bash
# Pre-deployment validation
python test_diagnose.py               # System diagnostic
./scripts/lint.sh                     # Final quality check
pytest tests/test_reliability.py -v   # API connection validation

# Environment verification
echo $OPENAI_API_KEY | head -c 10     # API key configured
curl -I http://localhost:8000/health  # Health endpoint responding
```

**Production Checklist**:
- [ ] Environment variables configured securely
- [ ] Database migrations applied (if applicable)
- [ ] OpenAI Assistant updated with latest knowledge
- [ ] Twilio webhook URL configured
